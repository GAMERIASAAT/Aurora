Aurora is an AI chatbot which uses Pyhton tensorflow and nltk.


the chatbot class uses an LSTM-based neural network to generate responses. The build_model method creates the neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is trained on a large dataset of conversations and then saved to disk, so that it can be loaded and used by the chatbot at runtime.

The generate_response method takes in user input, preprocesses it, and uses the trained model to generate a response. The preprocess_input method tokenizes the input and filters out non-alphabetic characters. The generate_response method then feeds the tokenized input into the model to generate a response, using a technique called "temperature sampling" to control the randomness and creativity of the generated text.
